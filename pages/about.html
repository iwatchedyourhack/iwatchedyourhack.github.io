<h3>The idea</h3>
The purpose of this website, is to showcase logs of compromises of SSH and Telnet, and the perpetrator's interactions, for our pleasure and entertainment.<br>
<p>
All logged interactions are authentic. We are doing this by exposing our poor honeypots out there in the dangerous interwebz and waiting for actual attacks. After that, it's all about watching the logs for indications of, well, whatever we find interesting or funny. In general, the more unique, the better.<br>
<p>
Some serious articles might appear here. We never know what might show up, in general we are looking for the fun interactions, but who knows, if something interesting shows up like a new malware strain or whatever, who are we to try to silence it, right? <br>
<p>
In general, posts on this page are about those "hacks" we talked about earlier. We are all up for discussion and criticism on those.<br>
<p>
<h3>This site</h3>
The site is maintained solely for entertainment and no profit, hence the absence of advertising. It's hosted on githubpages and thus for the foreseeable future will not require any extensive hosting solutions. In the future, if hosting the honeypots or the site itself require it, there might be a donation option for anyone interested.<br>
<p>
Anyone can submit articles to this website; to see how just visit the <a href="/contribute">Submit</a> page 
for information.<br>
<p>In general we use githubpages for the site, <a href="https://github.com/desaster/kippo">kippo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie">cowrie</a> honeypots and <a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a> to make the logs look pretty for you. If you want to submit an article you might need to be a bit familiar with those.
