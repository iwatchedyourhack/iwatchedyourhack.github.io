So, you want to contribute? Awesome! You can submit whatever related article you want, as long as it is releated to the purpose of the site. Sarcasm, condescending tone or funny writing style are <u>optional</u> but appreciated, we are not a very serious site. Again, serious articles are welcome as long as they are interesting. Obviously, to submit a story you need to have some honeypot logs, so don't forget about including those. 
<p>
There are two obvious ways to do that:
<p>
<h2>1. By submitting a pull request</h2>
The best way to submit an article is to create a pull request on our <a href="https://github.com/IWatchedYourHack/iwatchedyourhack.github.io">github repo</a>. 
You do this by forking the repo and creating a new article in the <i>_posts</i> directory. Keep in mind that the headers in the posts that are already there also need to be included in your article. Feel free to add any static content like images or whatnot in the respective folder and use them in your article.<br>
For more information about making the logs appear as they do here, take a look at the <a href="/about/">About</a> page to see what we use on this site.
<p>
Once you have done this create a pull request and wait for feedback or merge.
<p>
<h2>2. By email</h2>
The other method is by email. You can email <a href="mailto:admin@iwatchedyourhack.com">admin@iwatchedyourhack.com</a> with your story. You can send us the story and logs in html, text, or whatever (reasonable) format. Of course don't forget the logfile of your honeypot.<br>
Zip, Rar, Word, LaTeX, PDF or any other format is not acceptable and will be ignored.
