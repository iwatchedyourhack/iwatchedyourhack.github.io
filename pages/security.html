<h2>Reporting security issues</h2>
We know security is important. Mistakes are for people, and no single person can think of, and fix, everything.<br/><p>
That's why we would appreciate it if you would report any vulnerabilities found in this page, system or host to us. If it's not critical please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@iwatchedyourhack.com">admin@iwatchedyourhack.com</a> and give as much details as you can. Also, you can send us a DM on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/0xIWYH">@0xIWYH</a> for better and encrypted contact details.<br/>
<p>
We will publicly thank you for your report after the issue has been fixed, and your name will be added to the special thanks section at the bottom of this page.<br/>

<h2>Special thanks</h2>
